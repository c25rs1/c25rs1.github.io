Inside of the first div tag so before that first > and after the first time div is written, type the following: id='' or class=''.

" + linebreak + "An example is: animation-name: marbleRoll; " + linebreak + "The second step is setting the total amount of time that the animation runs for.

There are also other concepts like creating repeating images (see creating divs with functions as a seperate button) and event listeners (see the seperate button for that as well)." + linebreak + linebreak + "Basic Set Up" + linebreak + "The most basic set up of a function is as follows" + linebreak + "function functionNameHere(){" + linebreak + "what the function does when called" + linebreak + "}" + linebreak + "The above is what the function does after being called. A function on its own does nothing but can be called multiple times." + linebreak + linebreak + "Calling a function" + linebreak + "A function can be called once or on repeat if desired. Calling a function normally is simple. See the example:" + linebreak + "functionNameHere();" + linebreak + "Another way to do this on repeat rather than just saying functionNameHere(); over and over again is as follows:" + linebreak + "setInterval(functionNameHere,1000);" + linebreak + "This code sets how often the functio will run. In the example given above, it is every second." + linebreak + linebreak + "setInterval with a limiter" + linebreak + "This is an advance technique so only use this if you really understand it. An example is below and an explanation will follow it:" + linebreak + "var looper = setInterval(function(){" + linebreak + "looperCounter = looperCounter + 1;" + linebreak + "if (looperCounter == 1){" + linebreak + "clearInterval(looper);" + linebreak + "}" + linebreak + "},1000);" + linebreak + "Now for the explanation. If this made no sense, do not worry, that is normal! First the code defines a variable called looper and this can change as long as it stays constant throughout this interval code. Next, it defines the setInterval code described above except the function is not a name, but an actual function sitting in the setInterval. This function counts how many times the function has run with looperCounter. When looperCounter == 1 or a certain numeber of times, it was clearInterval or stop the loop. The frequency that it runs is defined by the 1000 at the bottom." + linebreak + linebreak + "Changing style in Javascript" + linebreak + "When changing the style of divs in javascript, type the div name a period and then the word style. After that type another period and the part you would like to change. See the below example:" + linebreak + "divName.style.top = 15px" + linebreak + "This changes the top of a div to 15px from its previous CSS definition. Note that you do not have to style everything in both CSS and Javascript, only in CSS. Also things like background-color in CSS are called backgroundColor in Javascript where the second word starts with a capital rather than having a dash." + linebreak + linebreak + "If statements/For loops" + linebreak + "If statements can be seen in an above example about setIntervals on this page. Essentially, the code is asking if (variable == number/variable){. The part coming after is what happens when any variable is equal to a certain number or another variable. Other operators like > or < or >= or <= can also be used. To say not equal to use != which can help with conditioning your random numbers. For loops start in a similiar matter" + linebreak + "for (let i = 0; i < 40; i++)" + linebreak + "This code creates a variable of i and defintes it. The second part sets a condition of how many times the code runs. This case being from run 0-39. Lastly, the final part sets that each time the code runs, the number of runs progresses by 1.";	
		var CC = "Creating divs with functions" + linebreak + "This code is used to repeatidly print images on screen. This can be done using a function that is working on an interval. There are three steps to it. One is to define a variable for the new div. The second line is to add that variable into the body making it a physcial div. Lastly, adding that to a class to be styled. The variable given has no impact on the actual code. Only the class given must be remembered to be included in the CSS code. See an example below:" + linebreak + "var variableName = document.createElement('div');" + linebreak + "document.body.appendChild(variableName);" + linebreak + "variableName.classList.add('className');";
		var CD = "Event listeners" + linebreak + "There are many types of eventlisteners. The most basic one is the click which checks to see if something or the body in general is clicked. This is written as follows:" + linebreak + "document.addEventListener('click', function(){" + linebreak + "Note that this function closes with }) and not just a bracket like other functions." + linebreak + "Despite where these eventlisterners are placed, they will always be active and listening for the click. If you would like to limit when it is searching add an if statement inside with a condition so that even if the click is detected, it will do nothing. The word document in the example can also be changed to the name of a div if it is a specific thing that you want to be clicked." + linebreak + linebreak + "Other types of eventlisterners (Look them up if you would like)" + linebreak + "Events related to the mouse include:" + linebreak + "mousedown, mouseup, click, dblclick, mousemove, mouseover, mousewheel, mouseout, contextmenu" + linebreak + "Events realted to touch include:" + linebreak + "touchstart, touchmove, touchend, touchcancel" + linebreak + "Events related to keyboard include:" + linebreak + "keydown, keypress, keyup" + linebreak + "Events related to form include:" + linebreak + "focus, blur, change, submit" + linebreak + "Events related to window include" + linebreak + "scroll, resize, hashchange, load, unload";
