		So far in CS1, I have learned how to create shapes and images and how to move them around the screen. Recently, I finished coding the design part of my website home screen which shows a background image that fills the screen, a tree, and a bird. I think it looks cool and it has taken me a considerable amount of time as I am not yet used to this format of coding. I was able to complete this by using nested divs which was a bit frustrating at first because as a parent div was moved, all the children divs moved as well. This made it hard to make small adjustments because it would lead to me having to fix all of the smaller issues that it would cause. Currently, I am designing my website to have multiple invisible boxes that link to different pages, which is my goal for the next few days. I want to make the invisible boxes hyperlink, but they are currently in nested divs. The problem with this is that one parent div will override the redirect code of its child div. I want to try and fix this which I think may result in me having to redo all the divs.

			Today, I worked on designing the journal page of my website. I was able to design the code to be copy paste so that I could easily enter new entries every time. I designed it with a heading as well as played with font sizing a little. I am trying to get the text to appear in a box by giving background colors in two columns, but I ran into an issue. I got the background colors, but to do that, I need to create a new class to break the texts from one another as I am using a br tag in the class of date. This creates a background color for that br as well which is the problem. This problem was just fixed as I wrote this. The other problem is that I do not know how to make the text alternate between two columns! Small change that I just made was to add a redirect bar to jump between pages at the top. This included making new divs and a tags to redirect the text to differet code pages.

			These last few days, I have spent a lot of time working with Java. I created an AboutMe page that has a similiar redirect bar to the Journal. The way the aboutme page looks is that you click on the screen to show letters that spell out my name that are placed where it is clicked. Then those letters organize themselves at the bottom of the screen under the bird in a transition. So, the first 9 clicks write my name, and the tenth click organizes the letters. The letters are screenshots of a fun text to make them easier to move around as a div. Clicking 5 more times creates 5 new text boxes about me which are also screenshots. The next click then organizes them. The hardest thing here was to make sure the letters were spaced out correctly as they are all different widths. I also worked on the jounral page. Now, to make the entry appear, one must hover over the empty space using the hover feature. The next step for the weekend will be to try and automate the home screen to make the birds and trees organize themselves and them have the trees turn into birds, and the birds fly away.

			Over the last few days, I have designed a Projects page and worked on creating links to the three projects that I have made thus far. (Two of which were also made during these last few days.) The original project was my person card which I added a cover photo, label, and redirect link. I found it card to figure out how to link something on codepen to this, so I just set it as a url to the code. However, I am sure there is a better solution to this. One of the new projects that I made was my gift for my father's birthday coming up! This project has a background image of a father and son watching the sunset. Then there are 5 thought bubbles around the family. These outlines can be hovered over to reveal a spin animation and something special between me and my father. While they are all combined loves for different things, the bubbles on the child's side represent things that I am closer to and vice versa for him. The bubble in the middle shows something both of us love equaly and something that often leads to bonding time. The most recent project that I made was for my Science Research Methods class. I am designing an expierement where I will show subjects a list of words with 5 seconds for each word. The study is testing to see if the background color of the word makes it easier to remember. Therefore, this code had me expierementing with wait commands or setTimeout. It was an interesting project to code and had me trying some things for the first time.

			Today, I worked on more javascript automatations. In today's class we did the official lesson on javascript functions. Therefore, I created a new code called Lion Showdown. I wanted to create a basic function that could create new divs and then every other div creates the same type of lion. One lion faces one way the other towards it. While, it would have taken too much code and a struggle of specific style sections, I decided to keep the infinite repeating quality of this and just make it scrolling. I tried to center the divs by using a  technique called auto margins. This sets margin-left and margin-right to auto meaning that it centers an entire class on one page. I further set up a if statement to alternate and worked with remainders to determine if the counter was even or odd. I did this by using the (counter%2==0) which means that if counter divided by 2 has a remainder of 0 then the statement is true. Then I used an else statement for the odd option. I further tried to research an automatic scroller, but it seems it requires external imports. To download the proper instruction, I needed admin permissions which I will try to aquire at a later date. Otherwise, the code was a success.

		Today, in CS1, I worked on javascript. I made my homescreen have invisible boxes behind the two sides of the sky and the field. These three parts were then coded with events to tell if they were clicked to run a function. I looked at previous student's code to try and find the way to control the function. What I found is to create a list that would keep adding to it for each new click. Then it would style a small icon to be added to the screen. This was not that difficult and I think it looks quite good. My next plan is for two things. One to create the journal to be side by side text boxes. Which I tried doing by setting two classes, but that did not work. Then the second thing is to create the AboutMe page to cycle through textboxes at the click instead of creating a div in a list.

		As I stated in my previous entry, my goal for this weekend was to automate my homescreen a little bit more. Up until this point, the aboutme page was much more animated and difficult than the homescreen, so I decided to make some changes. I already had the homescreen set to where birds would appear in the sky facing one of two directions based on where on the screen is clicked. Then the ground clicks turn into trees. The first step I did was to create an overall counter of how many clicks have occured. Then, I needed to change the code, so there were a maximum amount of clicks allowed in one space. Instead of using a while loop, I chose to use if statements so that each bird/tree would be a new div that I could control individually. After adding debugs into that to make sure they were working, I made it so each tree click actually stacked 4 trees in that spot, so as to use them later. This step also entailed adding variable definitions for each of the 60 trees and 13 birds. It also meant adding a style tag for each one as well. For the birds, the 77th thing placed on the counter will organize the birds into a flight triangle utilizing the big bird already on the screen. the other side would then mirror that appearence. Then the trees would split from their stacks into a 2 (one on each side of the main tree) 6x5 grids. The 78th click rotates the trees in unison by -70 degrees. The 79th click turns all the trees into birds and rotates them back up. The 80th click sets the original birds to fly off screen upwards. The 81st click makes the tree-birds fly up to the sky in unison. The 82nd click gives a nice timed effect as the birds all cross the screen to the sides off screen. Lastly, I added a else statement to make sure any clicks that were unwanted would undo the counter. This code was then copied so that the clicks anywhere on the screen would lead to the same actions. There are a few bugs with this new code. One, sometimes if the clicks happen too fast, the code is not able to register what step it is on and it skips ahead. Two, when making the 82nd click, the ground being clicked for the 82nd time does nothing. Three, the code has created an extended width somehow, that I do not know how to remove. I have tried debugging, and that has not worked. The next steps would be to try and make the code cycle back to the start at the end. The issue with that is every new bird would have to be converted to a tree offscreen (which was not working when I tried) and as I saw with the original problems, the trees would just be replaced with new tree divs. Overall, this code is a success.

		This week we learned and worked on making animations. I decided to start on an idea that Arav and Ajai also wanted to make. We had the goal of creating some sort of rube goldberg code that could have two computers run the same code and look like the animation carried from screen to screen. When starting on that, we made a marble roll down a slide and onto the next screen. The issue with this was the code get being very glitchy and the top control was not working. We later realized this was caused by the code wanting to transition to the next stopping top control and taking a different path to get there. This code is still in the works, but it is coming along. While researching about animations, I found a type of code that works with morphing shapes. This is similiar to the process of morphing from one color to another. I made one basic code ("Stretch") to try it and then wanting to play with dimensions and using multiple animations, I made another code ("Multi Stretch"). After learning about running multiple animations, I wanted to make a wave function. After learning the previous things with the Rube Goldberg, this was straightforward. This code is titled, "Marbles".
